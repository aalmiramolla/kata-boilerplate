# Template for Katas

An opinionated template for doing Katas

This template uses `pytest` with `memray`, `coverage` and `xdist` for running tests, `Mypy`, `flake8` and `flake8-pydocstyle` for checking style and types and `black` and `isort` to format the code.

You have to write the tests in `tests/` folder and write your solutions in `app/` folder.
